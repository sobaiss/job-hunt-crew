# Web

The candidate-facing Next.js app and its BFF (backend-for-frontend) proxy layer — the only context a browser ever talks to. Holds no direct connection to Postgres, S3, or SQS; every data operation crosses to the [API](../../services/api/CONTEXT.md) context over HTTP.

## Language

**BFF route**:
A Next.js `app/api/*` route handler that validates the caller's session, forwards the request to the API context (internal secret + `userId`), and passes the response straight through — no business logic of its own.
_Avoid_: API route (ambiguous with the API context itself), proxy

**Session**:
The signed NextAuth JWT identifying the signed-in candidate, valid for 30 minutes. Carries the canonical `userId` resolved from the API context at sign-in; this context never reads or writes a `User` row directly.
_Avoid_: Auth token, cookie

**Magic link**:
The Email-provider sign-in flow — a one-time link sent to the candidate's inbox. Its verification token is minted and consumed via the API context's endpoints, never stored here.
_Avoid_: Verification email, passwordless login

**Side-by-side comparison**:
The view listing every Analysis requested for one JobOffer across different CVVersions, so a candidate can compare their fit CV-by-CV.
_Avoid_: Compare page (that's the route, this is what it shows)
